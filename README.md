# Website Style Guide

## About the project

On this solo project for my Treehouse tech degree, I was provided with completed index.html and styles.css files for a brand style guide. I was required to convert the CSS into Sass/SCSS by creating several Sass partial files and utilising variables, mixins, colour functions and more.

### Built With

- Sass/SCSS
- CSS
- HTML
